# ☁️ Cloud Computing Fundamentals: Evolution and Architecture

## 💡 Introduction: What is Cloud Computing?

This repository contains essential cheat sheets and flashcards covering the fundamentals of cloud computing, its core models, the evolutionary path of modern hosting, and the landscape of Cloud Service Providers (CSPs).

Cloud computing is defined as the practice of using remote servers hosted on the Internet to manage and process data, rather than relying on local hardware. This shifts the operational burden away from the organization and onto the provider.

## I. Core Cloud Concepts

### A. Service Models (The Cloud Pyramid)

Cloud services are categorized into three models based on the level of abstraction and management handled by the user versus the provider. This progression moves from controlling core infrastructure to simply consuming a finished product.

### B. Deployment Models

Cloud architecture can be deployed in several configurations to meet business, regulatory, and technical requirements.

1.  **Public, Private, and Hybrid:** The most common models dictate where the workload is built—entirely on the CSP, entirely On-Premise (Private), or a combination of both (Hybrid).
2.  **Cross-Cloud (Multi-Cloud):** Utilizing resources across multiple CSPs, often employing technologies like Anthos or Azure Arc for unified control.

### C. Deployment Use Cases

The choice of deployment model is usually dictated by the organization's size, legacy systems, and compliance requirements. For instance, highly regulated industries often lean toward **Hybrid** or **On-Premise** solutions.
