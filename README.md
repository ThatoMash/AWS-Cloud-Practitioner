#  AWS Cloud Practitioner Journey

Welcome to my AWS Cloud Practitioner learning repository!  


 I’m **Thato Mashimbi**, an aspiring **AWS Cloud Practitioner** passionate about cloud computing and continuous learning.  
I’m exploring how AWS services work together to build secure, scalable, and cost-effective solutions in the cloud.  
This space documents my progress, notes, and hands-on labs as I build my foundational skills in **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.

##  What You’ll Find Here

-  **[Organized Notes by Module](#📘-modules-covered)**  
-  **[Hands-on Lab Documentation](./My-learning-journey.md)**  
-  **[Helpful Learning Resources](./Resources.md)**

## Modules Covered

##  AWS Core Services Explained

### Compute

* Compute is the processing power for applications.
* Examples I worked with: EC2 (virtual servers), Lambda (serverless functions)
* It is important because it determines app performance and scalability

### Networking

* Networking connects AWS resources securely.
* Examples I used: VPC, Route 53
* It is important because it controls traffic flow and resource communication

### Storage

* Storage is where I keep data, files, and backups.
* Examples I used: S3, EBS
* Storage is important because it provides durable, scalable storage for applications

### Databases

* Databases store structured application data.
* Examples I worked with: RDS, DynamoDB
* They are important because they ensure fast, reliable data access for apps

### Security

* I used IAM to control access.
* I learned about roles, policies, MFA, and basic encryption
* Security is important because it protects resources and data

### Labs Completed

I completed labs in Compute, Storage, Networking, and Databases. Each lab included:

* Step-by-step explanation in my own words
* Screenshots of the process
* Reasoning behind each step
