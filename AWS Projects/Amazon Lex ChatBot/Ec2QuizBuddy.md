# AWS Lex Interactive Ec2QuizBuddyChatbot Project

##  Introduction
In this project, we designed and built an interactive chatbot using **Amazon Lex** as part of the **AWS re/Start Special Projects programme (Praesignis)**.
Our goal was to explore how conversational AI works in practice and to create a chatbot that feels natural, useful, and engaging for users.

The project was completed in two phases:
- **Part 1:** Creating a basic chatbot to understand the fundamentals of Amazon Lex  
- **Part 2 (Challenge):** Expanding the chatbot into a quiz-based learning tool using conditional logic  

---

##  Project Overview
We built an Amazon Lex chatbot that uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to understand user input and respond in a structured and meaningful way.
The chatbot was designed to guide users through both informational and quiz-style conversations.

By the end of the project, we had a working solution that demonstrates how chatbots can be used as **simple, interactive learning tools**, especially in cloud education environments.

##  What We Set Out to Achieve
Through this project, we aimed to:

- Understand how Amazon Lex handles intents, utterances, and responses  
- Design clear and logical conversation flows  
- Build an interactive quiz that responds differently based on user input  
- Test and improve the chatbot through hands-on experimentation

##  Project Breakdown

### Part 1: Building the Basic Chatbot
We started by creating a simple chatbot to get comfortable with the core features of Amazon Lex.

#### What we did:
- Created an Amazon Lex bot using **English (ZA)** as the language
- Defined a single intent focused on **Amazon S3**
- Added common user phrases (utterances) the bot should recognize
- Configured a clear and helpful response
- Built and tested the chatbot in the Lex console

### Part 2: Quiz Chatbot (Challenge)
After building the basics, we extended the chatbot into a **quiz-based experience**.

#### Scenario
We worked through a fictional client scenario where an educational startup, **Cloud Learners Inc.**, 
needed a chatbot that could test learners’ knowledge of **Amazon S3** in an interactive way.

### Quiz Experience
The quiz chatbot was designed to:
- Ask multiple-choice questions in a clear format
- Accept answers such as **A, B, or C**
- Give immediate feedback for correct and incorrect responses
- Guide users smoothly through the quiz without confusion

##  Skills Demonstrated
Through this project, we demonstrated:
- Chatbot design and conversational flow planning
- Logical thinking using conditional branching
- Understanding of conversational AI principles
- Problem-solving and testing skills
- Clear technical communication and presentation ability

---

##  Testing and Validation
We tested the chatbot using the Amazon Lex test console by:
- Triggering quiz-related utterances
- Submitting correct and incorrect answers
- Verifying response accuracy
- Ensuring smooth progression through quiz questions

##  Presentation and Demonstration
As part of the project deliverables, we:
- Prepared a short presentation explaining Amazon Lex and chatbot functionality
- Conducted a live demonstration of the quiz chatbot
- Explained the technical approach, challenges encountered, and solutions applied

This strengthened our ability to communicate technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences.

---

##  Conclusion
This project provided hands-on experience with **Amazon Lex** and conversational AI.
By building both a basic chatbot and a quiz-based chatbot, we demonstrated our ability to design structured conversations, 
implement conditional logic, and deliver a practical solution aligned with real-world educational use cases.
