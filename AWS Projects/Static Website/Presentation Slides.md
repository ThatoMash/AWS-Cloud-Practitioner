## About Nastro Bliss

Nastro Bliss is a contemporary African restaurant located in Johannesburg, known for its modern take on African cuisine with a speciality in grill and fire dishes. The restaurant serves local residents, corporate clients, and tourists—and is now ready to scale its digital presence and customer experience.

## Current Business Challenges

Booking Confusion
Reservations come through multiple channels (phone, walk-ins, social media), leading to lost information and double bookings.
