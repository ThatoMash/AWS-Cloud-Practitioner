Reservation requests come
through multiple channels-
phone, walk-ins, social media.

booked tables create frustration.

### Order Mix-ups

Orders placed verbally or via
text lead to incorrect items,

forgotten requests, and
unhappy customers during
peak hours.

Without an organized online platform, customers can't easily find
menu information, hours, or availability-hurting discoverability.
