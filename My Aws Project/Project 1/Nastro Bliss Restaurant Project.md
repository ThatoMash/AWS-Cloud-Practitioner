## Introduction
This project demonstrates the development of a **static website for a restaurant** and highlights the benefits of hosting it on AWS.  
The goal is to improve customer interactions by providing an online platform for menu browsing, booking reservations, and submitting orders. Additionally, this project showcases how cloud services can streamline operations, reduce errors, and support scalability for growing businesses.

By building this project, we explore key AWS services such as **S3, CloudFront, Route 53, and CloudWatch**, and demonstrate a practical example of cloud migration benefits.
