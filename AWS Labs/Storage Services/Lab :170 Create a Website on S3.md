# AWS S3: Creating a Static Website with AWS CLI

## 📋 Project Overview

In this lab, I deployed a static website to Amazon S3 using the AWS CLI. During the project, I created S3 buckets, managed IAM users, enabled static website hosting, uploaded files, and automated deployments using bash scripts, gaining practical experience with S3-based website hosting and automation.

## 🎯 Objectives

 Configure AWS CLI and create S3 buckets
 Manage IAM users and permissions programmatically
 Enable static website hosting on S3
 Upload website files with public access
 Create automated deployment scripts
 Implement efficient file synchronization

## 📸 Screenshots

### 1. AWS CLI Setup & S3 Bucket Creation
**Screenshot 1: CLI Configuration and Bucket Creation**
- Shows: Running `aws configure` with credentials, creating S3 bucket with `aws s3api create-bucket` command, and JSON response showing successful bucket creation with Location URL
- File: `01-cli-config-bucket-creation.png`

This screenshot captures the complete AWS CLI setup process and S3 bucket creation including credential configuration and the create-bucket command execution.

### 2. IAM User Management
**Screenshot 2: IAM User Creation and Policy Attachment**
- Shows: Creating IAM user with `aws iam create-user`, creating login profile, listing S3 policies with `aws iam list-policies`, and attaching AmazonS3FullAccess policy. Also shows IAM console login screen with new user credentials.
- File: `02-iam-user-policy-management.png`

This screenshot demonstrates the complete IAM user lifecycle from creation through policy attachment and console access verification.

### 3. Bucket Configuration & File Upload
**Screenshot 3: S3 Permissions and Website Hosting Setup**
- Shows: S3 console with Block Public Access disabled, ACLs enabled, website hosting enabled with index.html as index document, and `aws s3 cp` command uploading files recursively with `--acl public-read` flag showing upload progress
- File: `03-bucket-config-file-upload.png`

This screenshot covers bucket permissions configuration, static website hosting enablement, and the file upload process in a single comprehensive view.

### 4. Website Deployment & Automation
**Screenshot 4: Live Website and Deployment Script**
- Shows: Browser displaying the live Café & Bakery website, terminal with `update-website.sh` script content, running `./update-website.sh`, and comparing `aws s3 cp` vs `aws s3 sync` efficiency (sync only uploads changed files)
- File: `04-website-deployment-automation.png`

This screenshot demonstrates the final working website, the deployment automation script, and the efficiency comparison between copy and sync commands.

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### AWS CLI Configuration
```bash
# Configure AWS CLI
aws configure
  AWS Access Key ID: <Your-Access-Key>
  AWS Secret Access Key: <Your-Secret-Key>
  Default region name: us-west-2
  Default output format: json
```

### S3 Bucket Creation
```bash
# Create bucket (replace with your unique name)
aws s3api create-bucket \
  --bucket twhitlock256 \
  --region us-west-2 \
  --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=us-west-2

# Response:
# {
#     "Location": "http://twhitlock256.s3.amazonaws.com/"
# }
```

### IAM User Setup
```bash
# Create IAM user
aws iam create-user --user-name awsS3user

# Create login profile
aws iam create-login-profile \
  --user-name awsS3user \
  --password Training123!

# Find S3 policies
aws iam list-policies --query "Policies[?contains(PolicyName,'S3')]"

# Attach S3 full access policy
aws iam attach-user-policy \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess \
  --user-name awsS3user
```

### Website Hosting Configuration
```bash
# Extract website files
cd ~/sysops-activity-files
tar xvzf static-website-v2.tar.gz
cd static-website

# Enable static website hosting
aws s3 website s3://twhitlock256/ --index-document index.html

# Upload website files with public read access
aws s3 cp . s3://twhitlock256/ \
  --recursive \
  --acl public-read

# Verify upload
aws s3 ls twhitlock256
```

### Deployment Script (update-website.sh)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Initial version - uploads all files
aws s3 cp /home/ec2-user/sysops-activity-files/static-website/ \
  s3://twhitlock256/ \
  --recursive \
  --acl public-read
```

### Optimized Script with Sync
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Optimized version - only uploads changed files
aws s3 sync /home/ec2-user/sysops-activity-files/static-website/ \
  s3://twhitlock256/ \
  --acl public-read
```

### S3 Permissions Configuration
```yaml
Block Public Access:
  - Block all public access: Disabled
  
Object Ownership:
  - ACLs: Enabled
  - Object ownership: Bucket owner preferred
  
Static Website Hosting:
  - Status: Enabled
  - Index document: index.html
  - Endpoint: http://twhitlock256.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com
```

## 💡 Key Learnings

### S3 Static Website Hosting
- **Cost-Effective**: No server management, pay only for storage and requests
- **Scalable**: Automatically handles traffic spikes
- **Fast**: Content delivered from S3's edge locations
- **Simple**: No database or application server needed

### AWS CLI Advantages
- **Automation**: Script repetitive tasks
- **Consistency**: Same results every time
- **Speed**: Faster than clicking through console
- **Version Control**: Scripts can be tracked in Git

### Deployment Efficiency
```
aws s3 cp (Copy):
  - Uploads ALL files every time
  - Use for: Initial uploads or complete refreshes
  - Time: ~10 seconds for 50 files

aws s3 sync (Sync):
  - Uploads ONLY changed files
  - Use for: Updates and incremental changes
  - Time: ~2 seconds for 1 changed file
  - Efficiency: 80% faster for updates
```

### IAM Best Practices
- Create specific users for different access needs
- Use managed policies (like AmazonS3FullAccess) when possible
- Programmatic access via CLI is auditable via CloudTrail
- Rotate credentials regularly

## 🔒 Security Considerations

**Implemented Security Measures:**
```yaml
IAM:
  - Separate user (awsS3user) for S3 operations
  - Policy-based access control
  - Console password protection

S3:
  - Public access limited to website files only
  - ACLs control object-level permissions
  - Bucket in specific region (us-west-2)

EC2:
  - IAM role for CLI access (no hardcoded credentials)
  - Systems Manager for secure connections
```
