# AWS Cloud Infrastructure Monitoring & Compliance Project



## 📖 Project Overview
In modern cloud environments, observability and compliance are critical for maintaining system uptime and security posture. This project focuses on implementing a robust monitoring solution for EC2 infrastructure.

Using **Amazon CloudWatch**, **AWS Systems Manager**, and **AWS Config**, I architected a solution to capture system-level metrics, analyze application logs in real-time, and automatically audit infrastructure for compliance deviations.

## 🚀 Project Tasks & Accomplishments

### Task 1: Installing the CloudWatch Agent
**What I did:**
I successfully installed and configured the CloudWatch Unified Agent on EC2 instances to enable deeper visibility into system performance.
* I used **AWS Systems Manager Run Command** to automate the installation across the web server fleet, eliminating manual SSH work.
* I stored the agent configuration in the **SSM Parameter Store** to ensure consistent settings for metrics and logs.

### Task 2: Monitoring Application Logs
**What I did:**
I configured CloudWatch Logs to ingest real-time data from the web server's access and error logs.
* I created a **Metric Filter** specifically to track HTTP 404 errors.
* I set up a **CloudWatch Alarm** that triggers an SNS email notification if the error count exceeds 5 in one minute, ensuring rapid response to potential application issues.

**Implementation Screenshots:**
*Log Groups & Metric Filters:*

### Task 3: Monitoring Instance Metrics
**What I did:**
I extended default monitoring capabilities to capture OS-level metrics that are not available out-of-the-box.
* I configured the agent to track **Memory Usage** and **Disk Utilization**, giving me a complete view of the instance's health.
* I verified these metrics in the CloudWatch dashboard to ensure data accuracy.

### Task 4: Creating Real-Time Notifications
**What I did:**
I built an event-driven notification system to alert the operations team about critical infrastructure changes.
* I created an **EventBridge Rule** to detect EC2 state changes (specifically `stopped` or `terminated`).
* I routed these events to an **SNS Topic**, ensuring that I receive an immediate email whenever a production server goes offline.

---

### Task 5: Monitoring for Infrastructure Compliance
**What I did:**
I implemented governance rules to ensure the environment remains secure and cost-efficient.
* I deployed **AWS Config rules** to automatically check for unattached EBS volumes (cost optimization).
* I set up compliance checks to verify that all EC2 instances possess the required project tags.

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways
* **Operational Excellence:** Automated the installation of monitoring agents, removing manual overhead.
* **Observability:** Transformed raw log data into real-time alerts, reducing potential Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) for application errors.
* **Cost & Compliance:** Utilized AWS Config to proactively identify wasted resources (unattached volumes) and enforce tagging standards.
