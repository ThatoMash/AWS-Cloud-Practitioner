# Lab: Introduction to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

##  Project Overview
In this lab, I acted as a Cloud Administrator to manage access control for a business environment. I moved away from a "single login" approach to implement a secure, identity-driven system. My work focused on creating a custom password policy, organizing users into functional groups, and validating permissions to ensure the **Principle of Least Privilege**.

##  Lab Objectives
* I created and applied a custom IAM password policy.
* I audited and explored pre-created IAM users and groups.
* I inspected JSON-based IAM policies (Managed and Inline).
* I implemented Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) by adding users to groups.
* I validated security boundaries by testing service access as different IAM users.

##  IAM Architecture & Business Scenario
I configured the environment to support specific job functions across three different users.

| User | Group Assignment | Permission Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **user-1** | `S3-Support` | Read-only access to Amazon S3 |
| **user-2** | `EC2-Support` | Read-only access to Amazon EC2 |
| **user-3** | `EC2-Admin` | View, Start, and Stop EC2 instances |

##  Step-by-Step Implementation

### Task 1: Creating an Account Password Policy
I strengthened the account security by implementing a custom password policy. I updated the minimum password length to **10 characters** and enforced complexity requirements.

### Task 2: Exploring Users and User Groups
I audited the existing identities to understand the baseline permissions. I specifically inspected the JSON policy for the Admin group to understand the allowed API actions.

### Task 3: Adding Users to User Groups
I assigned users to their respective groups so they would inherit the necessary permissions via RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).

### Task 4: Signing In and Testing User Permissions
I used the IAM Sign-in URL to log in as each user and verify the "Blast Radius" of their permissions.

* **Testing user-1:** I confirmed I could view S3 buckets but was blocked from EC2.

S3 Success

EC2 Denied

* **Testing user-2:** I verified I could view EC2 instances, but I was unauthorized to stop them.
* 
  EC2 Read Only

* **Testing user-3:** As the administrator, I successfully performed the "Stop Instance" action.
* 
  Stop Action Success
