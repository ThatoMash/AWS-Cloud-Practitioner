# AWS EC2 Hands-On Lab

## Overview
This lab demonstrates practical experience with **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**, a core AWS service that provides scalable computing capacity in the cloud. During this lab, I worked through the process of **launching, configuring, securing, monitoring, and scaling EC2 instances**, gaining a clear understanding of how cloud infrastructure behaves in real-world scenarios.

By completing this lab, I not only deployed a working web server but also explored **security, automation, and instance lifecycle management**, which are critical for building reliable and resilient cloud applications.

## Lab Architecture
The lab involved deploying a **web server** on EC2 with proper security and scalability:

## Lab Tasks

### 1️⃣ Launch EC2 Instance
I began by launching an EC2 instance named `Web Server` using the **Amazon Linux 2023 AMI**. I selected a **t3.micro instance type** and configured **termination protection** to prevent accidental deletion. Using a **User Data script**, I automated the installation of an Apache web server and deployed a simple web page.

### 2️⃣ Monitor the Instance
Once the instance was running, I explored monitoring options. I checked **system and instance reachability** via Status Checks, reviewed **CloudWatch metrics** for performance insights, and captured an **instance screenshot** to simulate console access.

### 3️⃣ Configure Security and Access the Web Server
Initially, my instance was not accessible through a browser because the security group blocked HTTP traffic. I modified the security group to allow inbound traffic on port 80 and successfully accessed the web server, confirming that the **automation script** had deployed the webpage correctly:

---

### 4️⃣ Resize the Instance
As part of understanding scalability, I stopped the instance and resized it from a **t3.micro → t3.small**, effectively doubling its memory. I also increased the **root EBS volume** from 8 GiB to 10 GiB, then restarted the instance. This step illustrated how EC2 instances can be dynamically scaled to match changing workloads.

### 5️⃣ Test Termination Protection
I tested termination protection by attempting to terminate the instance, which was initially blocked. After disabling the protection, I successfully terminated the instance. This task highlighted the importance of **safeguards in managing production environments**.

## What I Learned
Through this lab, I gained **hands-on experience with EC2 from start to finish**. I learned how to:

- Deploy and secure a web server using automation  
- Use security groups to control network traffic effectively  
- Monitor instance health and performance using CloudWatch  
- Scale compute and storage resources dynamically  
- Implement safeguards like termination protection to prevent accidental loss  

Overall, this experience deepened my understanding of **cloud infrastructure management** and gave me practical insight into building **resilient and scalable applications on AWS**.
